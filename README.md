Ares 2
======

[Overview](id:overview)
----------

Ares 2 is an open-source ([Apache 2](LICENSE-2.0.txt)) browser-based code editor and UI designer for developing [Enyo 2](http://enyojs.com) applications.

Applications made using Ares 2 rely on the Enyo highly portable web technology:  they are cross-platform (Linux/Mac/Windows, Android,/iOS/WindowsPhone/Windows8/webOS, Chrome/IE/Firefox/Opera), cross-form-factors (Desktop, Phone, Tablet, TV… etc).

[Roadmap](id:roadmap)
---------

### Current status

Although Ares is still a work in progress, we have reached the point where we are opening the repo and will do further development in the open, so we encourage you to follow our progress and give us feedback as we push Ares forward.

You can give us feedback either via the [Ares category of the EnyoJS Forums](http://forums.enyojs.com/categories/ares) or via the [EnyoJS JIRA](https://enyojs.atlassian.net/) (using the `ares` component).

Here are the main features you can start looking at today:

* De-centralized file storage
	* Ares currently connects to a filesystem component, to edit local files (via the `fsLocal` Hermes service).  Ares can also be configured to use a per-user Dropbox account (via the `fsDropbox` Hermes service) as file storage.  See below for more details.
	* Key goals with this approach are to avoid forcing users to store files and/or credentials on Ares servers and allow freedom to choose the preferred storage location, whether cloud or local.
* Code editor
	* Ares integrates the ACE (Ajax Cloud Editor, used by Cloud9 & Mozilla) code editor for code editing
* Code intelligence
	* Upon opening/editing a JavaScript file, Ares will parse the file and display a semantic outline of the code in the right-hand panel (for purposes of demonstrating parser)
	* Code completion using symbols from:
	  * the current project
	  * the Enyo version that comes with Ares
	  * the libraries included in the project
	* In the future, this will be used for advanced features context-sensitive documentation, etc.
* UI designer for drag and drop UI editing
	* Component definitions are round-tripped from the Editor to the Designer, meaning that changes made in one will immediately appear in the other.
* Integration with [PhoneGap online build](http://build.phonegap.com)
* Project sources
	* Allow creation of new projects based on bootplate templates.
	* Allow creation of new projects based on your own project templates.
	* See [Project sources](#project-sources) for more information
	
### Future plans

The following features are in the works, and you should see them added as we move forward:

* More code completion and context-sensitive documentation
* Additional Hermes components to extend the local and cloud file storage options: We plan to add Hermes components for FTP, Box.net and more
* Improvements to the Designer component for greater ease of use
* ... and more!

**Note:**  An up-to-date view of the ongoing activities is available from The [ARES JIRA](https://enyojs.atlassian.net/browse/ENYO/component/10302), itself available from the [EnyoJS JIRA](https://enyojs.atlassian.net/browse/ENYO).

[Usage](id:usage)
-------

### Install

1. Install Node.js 0.8.21 (or later, including 0.10.x) & its associated NPM (Node Package Manager) from a binary distribution, for example at [nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org/download/)
1. Install `ares-ide` using NPM:

		$ npm -d install ares-ide

	The `-d` options gives some minimal troubleshooting information, which is pretty useful as `ares-ide` is a heavy package (more than 12 MB).

1. Once installed, run it using `node_modules/.bin/ares-ide` (or `node_modules\.bin\ares-ide.cmd`) on Windows.
1. Please report the issues you find in our JIRA at [https://enyojs.atlassian.net/](https://enyojs.atlassian.net/) against the component named `ares`.

### Run

Start the IDE server: (e.g. using the Command Prompt, navigate to the ares directory and type `node ide.js`)… 

	C:\Users\johndoe\node_modules\.bin> ares-ide.cmd

… or (Mac & Linux):

	$ node_modules/.bin/ares-ide

In case you want to access other parts of your machine's file-system, refer to the [local filesystem service configuration](hermes/README.md#local-filesystem-service)

### [Reporting Issues](id:reporting-issues)

Be sure to run Ares with `--log` (or `-L`) to capture the Ares server output in the file name `ide.log`.  Attach this log-file to you bug report on the [ARES JIRA](https://enyojs.atlassian.net/browse/ENYO/component/10302).

You may also want to increase the log verbosity, in order to better understand what is going wrong by yourself.  The default verbosity level is `http`.  You may want o increase to `info` or even `verbose`.  Lowest layer `silly` is usually for Ares core developers.

	$ node ide.js --level=info

Known Bugs
----------

See this [list of known issues](KNOWN-BUGS.md)

[Features](id:features)
----------

### PhoneGap Build

See [Hermes README: PhoneGap build service](hermes/README.md#phonegap-build-service).

### Dropbox

See [Hermes README: Dropbox File-System service](hermes/README.md#dropbox-filesystem-service).

[Security](id:security)
----------

Ares does not store any security token or credentials on the server.  Client-side security tokens & credentials are stored either using Cookies or using HTML5 `localStorage`.

See [Hermes Security: Authentication](hermes/README.md#security).

[Extend](id:extend)
--------

Ares's plugin architecture is made to allow extensions, both in its UI (browser client) & its server.
 
### [Project sources](id:project-sources)

The service **genZip** defined in `ide.json` of ares-project or `ide-plugin.json` of Ares plugins allows to intanciate new Ares project from project templates such as "**bootplate**" or any customer specific project templates.

The property `sources:` of the service **genZip** lists the template definitions that are available at project creation time.

See the section "**Project template service**" in [hermes/README.md](hermes/README.md) for more information.

### [Ares plugins](id:ares-plugins)

Ares plugins can bring additional functionality and configuration to Ares.
An Ares plugin must follow these rules to be loaded as a plugin:

 * It must be installed in a directory under "_ares-project/node_modules_".  
 * It must have an `ide.json` in its main directory, which:
   * defines a new service entry
   * can define the client side code to load in the browser
   * can update some previously defined services (e.g.: modify/add project templates) 

#### Startup of "node ide.js"

At startup, the process "node ide.js":

 * loads the file `ide.json`
 * locates the plugins, using the first of the below method that works:
 	1. files `../../node_modules/*/ide-plugin.json` (production environment: npm installs Ares plugins aside Ares)
 	1. files `node_modules/*/ide-plugin.json` (development environment: npm installed Ares plugin under the Ares source tree)
 * sorts then in lexicographical order
 * merges them into the loaded configuration following the algorithm described in the next section.  While merging each plugin into the global configuration, the following variables are substituted:
 	* `@PLUGINDIR@`: the absolute location of each plugin root folder in the Ares server file-system.
 	* `@PLUGINURL@`: the URL to the plugin root URL, taken relatively to the Ares main page.
 * Globally substitute the following variables in the merged configuration:
 	* `@NODE@`: the path to the Node.js executable in use.  This is useful to start sub-process using the same executable
 	* `@CWD@`: Current-Working-Directory of the Ares process
	* `@INSTALLDIR@`: Root folder of `ares-project`, as it is loaded by Node.js.  This is the expected location of the `ide.js` main script.
	* `@HOME@`: the user's `$HOME` folder on Mac OSX & Linux, `%USERPROFILE%` on Windows.
 * starts services defined in the resulting loaded configuration

#### [Merging Ares plugin configuration](id:merging-configuration)

Ares plugin configuration are merged as follow:

 * New service entries are simply added to the current configuration
 * Service entries already existing in the current configuration are merged property by property as follow:
 	* New properties are simply added to the existing service entry
 	* For array, array entries are added to the corresponding array in the existing service
 	* For objects, object properties are applied to the corresponding object in the existing service
 	* Other properties of same type are applied to overwrite the corresponding entries in the existing service
 	* Properties with same name but different types are considered as errors and stop the startup process.
 * Other top level properties are not yet taken into account

#### Client side Ares plugin

The client code of an Ares plugin is defined by the property "`pluginUrl`" of a service entry in "ide.json".  
During the initialization process of Ares within the browser, the 'ServiceRegistry' will perform an 'enyo.load' of the javascript file (Usually a 'package.js' file) specified by the property "`pluginUrl`".  
After being loaded, the new code must invoke `ServiceRegistry.instance.pluginReady();` to notify Ares that the client side code is ready.  
See the function 'pluginReady' in the file 'services/source/ServiceRegistry.js'.

### Ares logo

It is possible to customize the logo displayed on the top-right corner of Ares.

For this, load your logo in ares (recommended size is 42x42px). Change the following line in ``utilities/source/Logo.js`` in the ``create`` function:

			this.setSource("path-to-your-logo");

To remove the logo's display from Ares, replace the call to ``this.setSource("path-to-your-logo")`` by:

			this.hideLogo();
