The special character should only occur in the end of the streamed content, and thus you'll have to check every chunk of data streamed and make sure it consist of an even number of bytes, any bytes above will have to be pushed to the beginning of the next chunk and encoded with it. This lib takes care of this for you and simply converts your content into properly base64 encoded content.\r\n\r\n## Example: Encode a file to base64\r\n```\r\nvar base64Stream = require('base64Stream');\r\n\r\nvar stream = new base64Stream.BufferedStreamToBase64();\r\nfs.createReadStream(file.path).pipe(stream);\r\n\r\n// Use stream and it will output it's data correctly encoded into base64\r\n```\r\n\r\n## MIT License\r\nCopyright (c) 2012 by Carl-Johan Blomqvist\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\r\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
